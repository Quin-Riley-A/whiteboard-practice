### Question #5: Array Sorting

Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the `sort()` method. There are many different sorting algorithms — take the time to read about the following:

-   Quick sort
-   Merge sort
-   Heap sort
-   Insertion sort
-   Bubble sort
-   Selection sort

You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem — as long as it doesn't use `sort()`.

#### Example

**Input**: `[9, 2, 7, 12]`

**Output**: `[2, 7, 9, 12]`

function mergeSort(inputArr) 
{
  const halfArr = inputArr.length / 2 //floor or ceiling?
  if (inputArr.length < 2) 
  {
    return inputArr;
  }
  else 
  {
    const leftArr = inputArr.splice(0,halfArr)
    return merge(mergeSort(leftArr),mergeSort(inputArr))
  }
}

function merge(left, right) 
{
  let arr = []
  while (left.length && right.length) 
  {
    if (left[0] < right[0]) 
    {
      arr.push(left.shift())  
    } 
    else 
    {
      arr.push(right.shift()) 
    }
  }
}

//would much rather make this a self contained function ill have to look at some of my older automata notes
